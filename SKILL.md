# Quote Batch

Generate quotation HTML, auditable calculation JSON and a batch index. This edition supports quotations only, not contracts, signatures, automatic sending or verified PDF output.

## Example entrypoint

For a freelancer preparing project and support quotations, start with [the sample brief](examples/freelance-quotes/request.md), [input and outputs](examples/freelance-quotes/README.md), and [structured input](examples/freelance-quotes/input.json). Use these as a reproducible example, then replace fictional facts with the user's approved source.

## Establish the source

Read [calculation contract](references/calculation-contract.md). Obtain issuer/client mapping, quote identifiers, validity dates, currency, approved scope/terms, quantities and prices. Do not infer tax rules, legal wording or bank information.

Use integer minor-unit prices and decimal-string quantities. Only listed two-decimal currencies are supported. Supply tax basis points explicitly: zero means a known zero rate, not an unknown rate. Confirm a different rounding policy instead of silently adapting.

## Build

Requirements: Python 3.10+, standard library only. From this skill directory:

```sh
python scripts/quotes.py assets/demo.json --out /tmp/quote-proof
python scripts/quotes.py /absolute/path/quotes.json --out /absolute/path/quotes-revision-01
```

Output must be empty. Whole input is validated first. Supplied totals must agree with recalculation; fix actual errors, never remove supplied totals just to pass.

## Verify and deliver

Read report.json and inspect every HTML document, line table, scope and terms. Check client mappings/dates against sources. Long descriptions and many-line documents require full review.

Builder does not render PDF. If requested, use an available PDF workflow and render every page; inspect splits, totals, fonts and headers. Deliver editable sources too. Arithmetic proof is not tax/legal validation or client approval.

Do not send documents or create signatures without explicit instructions.
